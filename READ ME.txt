listfiles.c -> implements the "ls -l" command of UNIX

backupfiles.c -> extends listfiles.c and it shows the files of current directory and sub-directories after a specific date using specified switches:
	-t {<filename>,<date>} path - used to specify the cut-off ?me for the incremental backup. 
				      The -t switch must be followed by the name of a file, or a quote 
				      delimited string containing a date in the format given above

	-h - program prints a help message explaining the usage of the command and then exits.

backup.c  -> extends backupfiles.c to an incremental backup utility by specifing the name of the archive file
				    that the current directory and sub-directories are going to be saved to
		
	-f <filename> - used to specify the name of the archive file to be created or used to restore
			files from the backup
